# CKD-Predictor

#Abstract:
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a severe medical condition that affects millions of individuals globally. Early detection and treatment can aid in preventing CKD progression to end-stage renal disease. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques have emerged as powerful tools for the early diagnosis and prediction of CKD
outcomes. In this project, we explore the potential of various ML approaches for early CKD diagnosis and use DL techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify the disease accurately. We construct a collection of prediction models using ML and predictive analytics, employing various assessment measures such as sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), and accuracy to evaluate classifier outputs. We use 10-fold cross-validation to check for over-fitting and nested cross-validation to refine the model's underlying parameters. We also use transfer learning with pre-trained CNN models such as VGG-16 which is trained on 38 classes and contains 16 layers, and ResNet which has 50 layers and extracts features that are not visible to the human eye, to develop a DL model that can effectively detect kidney diseases in CT-scan images, even with a limited dataset. This project's approach can be useful in predicting CKD and other kidney-related diseasesâ€™ treatment outcomes and identifying patients who are at risk.
